This Scanner is a simple python script that takes a wordlist, a website, and the input name that you wish to test.

Requires selenium and geckodriver. Will continue to work on features and fix bugs. This is currently both slow and buggy, so feel free to suggest changes. 

Currently, I have only used firefox with this.
